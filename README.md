# ECMAScript proposal: set notation in regular expressions

## Authors

- Markus Scherer
- Mathias Bynens

## Status

This proposal is at stage 1 of [the TC39 process](https://tc39.es/process-document/).

## Summary

In ECMAScript regex character classes, we propose to add syntax & semantics for the following set operations:

- difference/subtraction (_in A but not in B_)
- intersection (_in both A and B_)
- nested character classes (_needed to enable the above_)

## Motivation

Many regular expression engines support named character properties, mostly reflecting Unicode character properties, to avoid hardcoding character classes that may require hundreds of ranges and that may change with new versions of Unicode.

However, a character property is often just a starting point. It is common to need additions (union), exceptions (subtraction), and ‚Äúboth this and that‚Äù (intersection). See the recommendation to support set operations in [UTS #18: Unicode Regular Expressions](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/#Subtraction_and_Intersection).

ECMAScript regular expression patterns already support one set operation in limited form: one can create a union of characters, ranges, and classes, as long as those classes are `CharacterClassEscape`s like `\s` or `\p{Decimal_Number}`.

A web search for questions about regular expressions with such set operations reveals workarounds such as hardcoding the ranges resulting from set operations (losing the benefits of named properties) and lookahead assertions (which are unintuitive for this purpose and perform less well).

We propose adding syntax & semantics for difference and intersection, as well as nested character classes.

## Proposed solution

We propose to extend the syntax for character classes to add support for set difference/subtraction, set intersection, and nested character classes.

## High-level API

Within regular expression patterns, we propose enabling the following functionality.
We have not yet settled on several issues including single vs. double punctuation,
some distinct prefix to not break existing expressions (see FAQ), etc.

```
// difference/subtraction
[A--B]

// intersection
[A&&B]

// nested character class
[A--[0-9]]
```

Throughout these high-level examples, `A` and `B` can be thought of as placeholders for a character class (e.g. `[a-z]`) or a property escape (e.g. `\p{ASCII}`). See [the illustrative examples section](#illustrative-examples) for concrete real-world use cases.

## Illustrative examples

Real-world usage examples from code using ICU‚Äôs `UnicodeSet` which implements a pattern syntax similar to regex character classes (modified here to use `\p{Perl syntax for properties}` rather than `[:POSIX syntax for properties:]` ‚Äî `UnicodeSet` supports both):

- Code that looks for non-ASCII digits, to convert them to ASCII digits:

    ```
    [\p{Decimal_Number}--[0-9]]
    ```

- Looking for spans of "word/identifier letters" of specific scripts:

    ```
    [\p{Script=Khmer}&&[\p{Letter}\p{Mark}\p{Number}]]
    ```

- Looking for ‚Äúbreaking spaces‚Äù:

    ```
    [\p{White_Space}--\p{Line_Break=Glue}]
    ```

    Note that ECMAScript currently doesn‚Äôt support `\p{Line_Break=‚Ä¶}` ‚Äî this is an illustrative example regardless.

- Looking for emoji characters except for the ASCII ones:

    ```
    [\p{Emoji}--[#*0-9]]

    // ‚Ä¶or‚Ä¶

    [\p{Emoji}--\p{ASCII}]
    ```

- Looking for non-script-specific combining marks:

    ```
    [\p{Nonspacing_Mark}&&[\p{Script=Inherited}\p{Script=Common}]]
    ```

- Looking for ‚Äúinvisible characters‚Äù except for ASCII space:

    ```
    [\p{Other}\p{Separator}\p{White_Space}\p{Default_Ignorable_Code_Point}--[\x20]]
    ```

- Looking for ‚Äúfirst letter in each script‚Äù starting from:

    ```
    [\P{NFC_Quick_Check=No}--\p{Script=Common}--\p{Script=Inherited}--\p{Script=Unknown}]
    ```

    Note that ECMAScript currently doesn‚Äôt support [`\p{NFC_Quick_Check=‚Ä¶}`](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/#Quick_Check_Table) ‚Äî this is an illustrative example regardless.
    
- All BMP code points that are either a letter, a mark (e.g. diacritic), or a decimal number:

    ```
    [\p{BMP}&&[\p{L}\p{M}\p{Nd}]]
    ```
    
- All code points, except for those in the "Other" General_Category, but add back control characters:

    ```
    [\p{any}--\p{C}\p{Cc}]
    ```

- All assigned code points, except for separators:

    ```
    [\p{assigned}--\p{Z}]
    ```

- All right-to-left and Arabic Letter code points, but remove unassigned code points:

    ```
    [\p{BidiClass=R}\p{BidiClass=AL}--\p{unassigned}]
    ```

- All right-to-left and Arabic Letter code points with General_Category "Letter":


    ```
    [\p{L}&&[\p{BidiClass=R}\p{BidiClass=AL}]]
    ```

- All characters in the "Other" General_Category EXCEPT for format and control characters (or, equivalently, all surrogate, private use, and unassigned code points):

    ```
    [\p{C}--\p{Cf}--\p{Cc}]
    ```


## FAQ

### Is the new syntax backwards-compatible? Do we need another regular expression flag?

It‚Äôs an explicit goal of this proposal to not break backwards compatibility. Concretely, we don‚Äôt want to change behavior of any regular expression pattern that currently does not throw an exception. We believe this is possible by doing the following:

- First, we limit this new functionality to regular expressions with the `u` (Unicode) flag.
- Second, we limit the new syntax to a new escape sequence such as `\UnicodeSet{‚Ä¶}`.
  (We have not yet settled on exactly which syntax to use.)

This addresses all back-compat concerns because `\U` throws in Unicode regular expressions (but it doesn‚Äôt in non-Unicode mode, which is why we can‚Äôt support non-Unicode mode). Banning the use of unknown escape sequences in `u` RegExps was [a conscious choice](https://web.archive.org/web/20141214085510/https://bugs.ecmascript.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3157), made to enable exactly this kind of scenario.

Scoping the syntax in this manner also removes the need to introduce a new regular expression flag for this functionality.

### What‚Äôs the precedent in other RegExp flavors?

Several other regex engines support some or all of the proposed extensions in some form:

<sup>\*</sup> Subtraction is [documented](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/java.base/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#subtraction1) as intersection with negation. With only support for negation + nested classes, you already have the functional equivalent of intersection & subtraction: `[^[^ab][^cd]] === [[ab]&&[cd]]` and `[^[^ab][cd]] === [[ab]--[cd]]`. This is just not very readable. For this reason, our proposal includes dedicated syntax for intersection and subtraction as well.

These all differ somewhat in syntax and semantics (e.g. operator precedence). References:

### How does this interact with properties of strings a.k.a. [the sequence properties proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-unicode-sequence-properties)?

If the committee accepts stage 1 for this set notation proposal, we commit to describing the exact interactions between the two proposals on the path to stage 2/3.
